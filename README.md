# StateTest

This demo app is about adding another layer of abstraction between the actual view and business logic. Rendering logic is pulled out from views and put into interface to make views more dumb. I've demonstrated the process using Test Driven Development. So view the code commit-by-commit to learn the process. There is also a detailed article I wrote to explain its need and working.
